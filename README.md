# Grow and Get Better

At Liferay, one of our core principles is "Grow and Get Better" &mdash; but as we've been building out our Design Team, we realized that we didn't know exactly how to do that. Of course we all have ideas about what personal and professional growth looks like, but that was part of the problem &mdash; they were all our own ideas, in our own heads &mdash; what we needed to do was to come together, combine our ideas and experiences, and share it so we could actually have a clear idea of how you grow and get better as a designer here at Liferay.

To read more about this process, check out our [growth framework documentation](TODO:write-growth-blogpost).

Our growth tool is hosted [publicly](https://grow.liferay.design).
